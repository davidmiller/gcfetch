We'd like you to write a web crawler in a modern, dynamic language. Something like Ruby, Python, PHP or JavaScript. It should be limited to one domain - so when crawling gocardless.com it would crawl all pages within the gocardless.com domain, but not follow the links to our Facebook and Twitter accounts. Given a URL, it should output a site map, showing which static assets each page depends on, and the links between pages. Choose the most appropriate data structure to store & display this site map.

Bonus points for making it as fast as possible! Don't spend too long on it - it should probably take you a couple of hours.
